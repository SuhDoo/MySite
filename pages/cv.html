		<h2>Profile</h2>
		<p>
		  I get great joy out of bringing value through doing what I'm good at. 
		  Where I thrive is having a defined target and figuring out how to get there and what that take. 
		  I thrive in the technical, mathmatical strategy of operationalising a plan and have developed a great love for working with the humans that make those plans a reality.
