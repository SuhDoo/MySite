    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Right now I'm on a journey to parctice being more present in myself and my life. There are a lot of pressures and distractions that take me away from that so I've decided to try a different approach. This website will suck for a long time and that's okay - if it wasn't allowed to be bad, it would never exist. \n \n I'm now transitioning from a year of travel, contemplation and exploration towards a new direction. I want to find something to throw myself into and see what I can learn and grow. In order to find exciting opportunities I have to put myself out there and show people who I am. This is always challenging, but we've decided we like challenges now.</p>
